NAME: AI Detector Tester
This app was built for the purpose of testing several AIDetectors, in connection with a bachelor thesis whether it's possible to disclose AI-images.

Currently the app can upload images to 4 detectors simultaneous: IsitAI.com, Illuminaty.ai, contentatscale.com and hivemoderation.com
The results are then saved in a SQL-database.

The upload procces of images are automated with Selenium. 

The app runs on a flask framework, making it very easy to view the saved results from different pages that can be configured to handle the data in different ways from a web browser locally.
